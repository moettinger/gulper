gulper
=======

A Finder button that can open the current folder in Sublime Text 2, Terminal, and run the command "gulp".

1. Put the application wherever you want - I recommend the Utilities folder. 
2. Command + drag the application to your Finder toolbar
3. Select a folder you want to work with, hit the gulp icon, and voila!
