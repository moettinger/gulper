gulper
=======

A Finder button that can open the current folder in Sublime Text 2, Terminal, and run the command "gulp".

1. Put the application wherever you want - I recommend the Utilities folder. 
2. Command + drag the application to your Finder toolbar
3. Select a folder you want to work with, hit the gulp icon, and voila!

* Has only been tested on Mac OSX 10.9.3.

## Tweaking

If you want to change the application from Sublime Text 2 to another editor, simply open the application in AppleScript Editor and change out "Sublime Text 2" for your application of choice.
